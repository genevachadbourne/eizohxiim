                            <p> I'm not sure if I can go an alternate route with this. I have the SGH i317m Rogers Canada. I'd like to make my own ROM image backup of the phone (now rooted) before I put a custom one on as well (obviously a good idea) Any help would be greatly appreciated. My galaxy nexus (gsm) wont turn on, it gets stuck at the google logo and then I have to do a battery pull. I have to take it to my carrier to get it fixed however I want to see if I can avoid doing that. I'm able to boot into clockwork recovery and the bootloader BUT both pc and mac wont let me access the internal storage via usb to put one of my backups on or manually reflash via fastboot. On a pc it says USB device not recognized and on a mac nothing comes up. The phone isn't rooted So I have some (stupid) questions. I have the Samsung Galaxy S Plus GT-i9001. I;m running the official version of 2.3.3 and have rooted the device, using recovery mode. The question is which version of cyanogenmod should I get, will any work or should I use any specific one? Also if I install it, will the root still stay or I will have to do it from scratch. Also will I lose all my data, such as apps or files? Thank. Hi I was trying to follow this guide: but I got to the step where I was supposed to flash SU from sdcard. But mine said "unable to mount sdcard" Now when I reboot it gets stuck at the nexus color screen. Recently, I've reinstalled my entire mod list just as a matter of course - I do it every once in a while if I go on a long hiatus from the game. It included a complete reinstall of the game and everything, so I know there's no "accidental" leftover stuff anywhere as far as I am aware. However, one (or more) of my mods appear to be using some sort of item sorter, appending Ammo to the front of most vanilla ammunition types, and (to use the example of a Short Laser Musket) Fusion Laser Musket. When I am in clockworkmod recovery the volume rocker will skip maybe 2 sometimes 3 selections. I don't know if this is my phone or a known problem. Is there 
I'm currently running CM 11.0-20140110 and Recovery 5.8.4.5 ( I got a notification there was an update, so I downloaded it, but when I attempt to install (either auto or manually) I get a msg in CWM Recovery. This package is for "d2vzw" devices; this is a "d2spr". But this more certainly is not a d2spr. I'm on Verizon, I bought this phone from Verizon. I pay Verizon every month.lol. Where does CWM Recovery pull this information? Can I change Hi there, sorry for yet another post about a CM install but I guess it just goes to show what an object of desire it is! I have CM on my HTC desire, and the install was fairly painless. I'm trying to install it on my HTC sensation now and it turns out to be a much more convoluted affair. I'm trying to follow the instructions from here: I have unlocked the phone using the HTC service. I am now supposed to gain S-OFF but given my HBOOT (1.27. Yesterday I was going to bed. Decided to check if the update was there and BAM. System Update available. I go and select update. My phone reboots and hits the rom manager (My phone is rooted) I had a menu that's ask me if I would like to apply the zip file with the options like this NO NO NO NO YES NO NO I was going to press yes. But by accident I hit No. Phone rebooted and now I don't see the update anymore. Kinda of newcomer in the Android world. So please forgive Just curious if anyone here is using CWMR Touch. Does it work just as well as its non-touch counterpart? How's the interface? I feel like there would be less opportunity for accidental menu selections (power button registering two presses with one, etc). Would like to hear your overall experience 
I'm trying to play AILD's The sound of Truth, yet for some reason I'm struggling with that main riff (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K91qwxCWmrs&t=0m24s). I'm just not finding that picking rhythm, mostly due to the muted notes. I noticed I had the same issue when first practicing Meaning in Tragedy, yet that song randomly just "clicked" and I was able to play it. Is there something specific I'm missing to get that song to just stick. Title says it all. Just decided to get back into Fallout 4 after a few years because why not. This time I'm using Vortex to manage the mods and, well, I have 221 installed. I always tell myself I'll only have a few, but one thing leads to another and, well, you know how it goes.

Just realized upon loading up my modded game again (I haven't touched it for a while) the face textures look messed up. I tried to create a new character, and even from the character creation both Nate and Nora's faces are checkered already. I have done nothing to the textures since then but I reinstalled the female textures I use (I don't have any for males), even CBBE, to no avail. The checkered face looks like this (https://i.imgur.com/aaElwjn.png).

I am doing my modded play-through and I have tried countless times to get this mod to work. I keep getting Prison jumpsuits that look like the Red Rocket Mechanic outfits. I've tried patches and the hotfix and have no idea what this could be. Here's a link to the nexus page: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/9103/?tab=files (https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/9103/?tab=files) Is there an older version of the mod that WORKS? I love the new raider behavior and in my attempts hello everyone, I was hoping to get some assistance. I am unable to locate the source of my CTD problem. I am getting no response when launching FO4 with the up to date f4se. A black box appears very quickly with no text then disappears. If I am able to get to the home menu, loading my recent save results in a CTD. I am sometimes able to load into the world but if i die it will CTD at the end of the loading screen. I also encounter some rare CTD in the wasteland but I figured it comes If this is the wrong place for this, I'll move it, but I got an issue.
