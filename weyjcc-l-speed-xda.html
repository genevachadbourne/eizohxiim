Firstly, I'm not the dev of this app (or, any app for that matter) Secondly, I don't know how to make that title sound less sensational, but it's very true. I've been following its progress for a bit over a month now, and it has evolved a lot since then. The dev is super responsive and updates incredibly fast and often. It does require root and init.d support, but if you have those then L-Speed will work regardless of the iteration of Android you're on. After using the stock Touchwiz launcher.

There were a lot of unknowns for me since I have never bought a Chinese phone, let alone one that is not officially supported by my carrier (Verizon) or officially sold in my country (United States).

So, I was deep into nova launcher customizatons and setup videos when I came across some reddit posts where users reported that the navigation gestures animations on the OP6T and OP6 are not as smooth if youre not using oxygen OS default launcher. Since I bought the 6T mainly for the speed, smoothness and user experience, Im not keen into installing nova launcher anymore.

I'm running LineageOS 16.0 on my kltedv (SM-G900P, US Sprint) and I recently found this mod (https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s5/unified-development/mod-15-1-camera-supporting-60fps-120fps-t3809145) that is supposed to give 60 FPS video recording functionality to my camera.

Now iDan was creating a Pixel 3 configuration but found it much harder than he anticipated and so he brought in Arnova (The God of Gcam, he has created a lot of the GCam ports on other phones etc.) to help him.

Have been reading through some posts and have some questions on how to get the best out of the V30: 1) Do you adjust app scaling in Display settings? For example if you scale to 1080p, in youtube no 1440p option appears. For now I have left the app scaling at 1440p, but use game settings to lower resolution/fps for some games that don't require it. Or should i just set app scaling to 1080p and leave the game setting. This is done for a number of reasons (such as heat generation), but some modders have figured out a way to increase the wireless charging speed of the Pixel 3. XDA Senior Member k0rner published this mod over the weekend and said he was able to increase the wireless charging current. 
This animation basically made me use fingerprint scanner again, I thought default animation was kinda bad and it didn't even work as intended. All you need is Settings Database Editor from Google Play (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=by4a.setedit22) doesn't require root. If you're already using fingerprint scanner just find "op_custom_unlock_animation_style" and change it's value from 1 to 3, in case you aren't using fingerprint scanner simply add new setting called op_custom_u.
